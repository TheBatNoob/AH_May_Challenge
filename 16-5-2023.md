Initialize an empty set to store the layouts that have been encountered.
Set the current layout as the given start state.
Iterate through each minute, following these steps:
a. Check if the current layout is already in the set of encountered layouts.
If it is, break out of the loop as we have found the first repeated layout.
b. Add the current layout to the set of encountered layouts.
c. Update the grid according to the given rules:
Iterate through each cell in the grid.
Count the number of adjacent lifeforms or empty spaces for each cell.
Apply the rules to update the cell's state.
d. Increment the minute counter.
Calculate the lifeform score for the first repeated layout:
Identify the position of the layout (e.g., (3, 0) for the given example).
Convert the position to the corresponding tile number.
Calculate the lifeform score using the formula 2**(the tile number).
Return the lifeform score.
