Initialize a variable steps to 0 to keep track of the number of moves.
Initialize a variable i to 0 as the starting index.
Iterate while i is less than the length of the series:
a. Initialize a variable j to i + 1 as the next index.
b. While j is less than the length of the series and the character at index j is the same as the character at index i, increment j by 1.
c. If the number of characters between indices i and j is equal to 1 (i.e., there are no repeated characters), increment steps by 1.
d. Set i to j.
Return the value of steps as the minimum number of moves required.
